# HTML-Git-CSS Code Refactor for SEO

## Description

This project was created to refactor an existing webpage
so that it is optimized for search engines.
The HTML semantics have been reformatted to match a consistent and reasonable structure 
and the links have been edited to funciton properly.
Through this project I learned to assess a web page to be properly formatted 
to create a more cohesively understood set of HTML code.
